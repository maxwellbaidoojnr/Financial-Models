The box plot shows the distribution of ages for customers who did and did not default on their payments. 
The median age for non-defaulters is slightly higher than that for defaulters, suggesting that older customers are less likely to default.
However, there is significant overlap in the distributions, indicating that age alone is not a strong predictor of default.

The box plot shows the distribution of credit limits for customers who did and did not default on their payments. 
The median credit limit for non-defaulters is higher than that for defaulters, suggesting that customers with higher credit limits are less likely to default. 
However, there is significant overlap in the distributions, indicating that credit limit alone is not a strong predictor of default.


The bar chart shows the distribution of payment statuses in the previous month. The most frequent status is 0, indicating that the majority of customers paid their bills on time. 
There are also a significant number of customers with payment statuses of -1, -2, and 2, indicating delayed payments or a history of default.
